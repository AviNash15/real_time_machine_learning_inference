### real_time_machine_learning_inference

### This repository contains a small flask based app for model inference in real time.

### I have also attached sample screenshots.

### Steps for inference

	1.Load the saved model
	2.Preprocess the text
	3.Pass preprocessed text to model for prediction
	4.Render the output in desired format
	5.Display output on frontend  

### To run 

	python main.py 
	It will start flask server
	Then goto
	localhost:6001
